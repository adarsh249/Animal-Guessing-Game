"# Animal-Guessing-Game" 

A command line game in Java, where the program will guess the animal you are thinking of. If you get the animal wrong, you type a question that would be correct in guessing that animal. You will keep this loop going as long as you want.

Features in the works:
Saving every question locally on each computer, so it doesn't lose memory of the questions.
